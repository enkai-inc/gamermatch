# CLAUDE.md


<IMPORTANT>
## Critical Constraints - NEVER VIOLATE

### Protected Constants
- NEVER modify `PROTECTED_CONSTANTS.md`
- ALWAYS import from protected constants instead of hardcoding
- Includes: GitHub owner/repo, bot accounts, domain names, resource prefixes

### Autonomous Operation
- Execute `/scrum` and automated workflows WITHOUT asking for permission
- Complete workflows autonomously, report results at end

### GitHub Actions - ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
- NEVER create, modify, or add GitHub Actions workflows (.github/workflows/)
- All CI/CD is handled by AWS CodeBuild/CodePipeline, not GitHub Actions
- This applies to ALL repositories

### AWS Infrastructure Preferences
- **Compute**: ALWAYS prefer ECS Fargate - no EC2, no Lambda for long-running services
- **CI/CD**: Use AWS CodePipeline + CodeBuild exclusively
- **Amplify**: NEVER use AWS Amplify - avoid at all costs

### GitHub Label Convention — enkai: prefix
All automated build labels use the `enkai:` prefix across ALL repos (pedro, enkai, enkai-monitor, etc.):

| Label | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `enkai:build` | Issue queued for automated processing |
| `enkai:in-progress` | Currently being worked by a builder |
| `enkai:pr-open` | PR created, awaiting review/merge |
| `enkai:done` | Completed (or just close the issue) |
| `enkai:needs-human` | **Blocks automation** — requires human decision |

**Why "enkai:"**: enkai is the automated build *system* (the orchestrator). frank containers are the current execution *mechanism*. Labels reflect the system's workflow state, not the executor. Future builds may use Claude API directly instead of frank containers.

**Label creation**: When `/scrum` decomposes an already-labeled issue, it should create missing `enkai:*` labels in the repo if they don't exist.
</IMPORTANT>

## Context Modes

Behavioral rules are loaded per-session based on the active context mode. This reduces token usage by ~30-40% compared to loading all rules upfront. The context loader hook (`.claude/hooks/context-loader.py`) activates the appropriate mode when a skill is invoked.

| Mode | File | Skills |
|------|------|--------|
| **dev** | `.claude/contexts/dev.md` | `/scrum`, `/build`, `/bug`, `/execute`, `/feature-dev`, `/tdd-discipline`, `/deploy`, `/mcp-builder`, `/root-cause-trace` |
| **research** | `.claude/contexts/research.md` | `/dd`, `/design`, `/idea`, `/observatory`, `/plan`, `/confidence-check` |
| **review** | `.claude/contexts/review.md` | `/code-review`, `/critic`, `/checker`, `/verify`, `/gh-triage`, `/correct-course`, `/judge-with-debate`, `/contract-review`, `/do-competitively`, `/skill-eval` |

Default mode is **dev** for unrecognized skills. Context files are in `.claude/contexts/`.

## Skill Deployment Rings

Skills are organized into deployment rings to minimize baseline token consumption.
See `.claude/skill-rings.json` for the full configuration.

**Always ring** (~70KB, loaded every session): build, scrum, bug, execute, verify, plan
**Frequent ring** (~114KB, on-demand): design, dd, deploy, code-review, test, clean, resolve, confidence-check, correct-course, feature-dev, mon, checker, skill-eval
**Archive ring**: eval (absorbed by /scrum in unified build system v2)
**Specialized ring** (~164KB, explicit invocation only): atlas, context, critic, deps, do-competitively, frontend-design, gh-triage, idea, maint, marketing, mcp-builder, observatory, enkai-relay, ratchet, rollback, root-cause-trace, secrets, skillify, tdd-discipline

### Fresh Context Per Agent

Skills that orchestrate sub-agents (scrum, build, design) use **minimal context profiles** — each sub-agent starts with clean context specific to its task, not the full CLAUDE.md + all skills. See individual skill files for per-agent context definitions:
- `/scrum` — scrum master vs. Codex builder profiles (`scrum/SKILL.md`)
- `/build` — scaffolder, implementer, reviewer, CI runner profiles (`build/SKILL.md`)
- `/design` — 9 specialized design agents (`design/SKILL.md`)

### Unified Build System (v2)

**Human-driven research and design. Machine-driven execution.**

```
RESEARCH → DESIGN (Double Diamond) → PLAN → BUILD (6x Codex Builders)
```

| Phase | Skill | Agents | Output |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|
| **RESEARCH** | `/idea` or manual | Human + Claude | GitHub issue + research report |
| **DESIGN** | `/design` | 9 specialized | 30+ artifacts in `docs/design/${FEATURE_ID}/` |
| **PLAN** | `/plan` | Planner | Epic + feature specs |
| **BUILD** | `/scrum` | Scrum Master + 6 Codex | Work Units → PRs |

### Idea-to-Production Pipeline

`/idea` → `/design` → `/plan` → `/scrum`

1. **Idea**: Capture and initial research
2. **Design**: Double Diamond (Discover → Define → Develop → Deliver) with 9 specialized agents
3. **Plan**: Decompose into epics and feature specs
4. **Build**: Scrum Master decomposes to Codex-simple Work Units, 6 builders execute in parallel

### Continuous Improvement Pipeline

`/observatory scan` → `/observatory publish` → `/design` → `/plan` → `/execute`

1. **Scan**: Poll watched repos for changes, download and analyze with scoring subagent
2. **Publish**: Create GitHub issues from high-priority findings (score >= 7), batch digests (4-6)
3. **Design**: Deep-dive high-value proposals through 6-dimension research
4. **Plan**: Evaluate adoption complexity, plan integration
5. **Execute**: Implement the approved adaptations

Run `/observatory scan` daily (or via heartbeat). Run `/observatory report` to check status.

### FPF Trust Calculus

The First Principles Framework (FPF) provides evidence-based reliability scoring for decisions. The FPF agent (`.claude/agents/fpf-agent.md`) is integrated into `/plan` and `/design` skills:

- **R_eff scoring**: Quantifies decision reliability as `R_eff = Self_Score x min(Evidence_R) x Product(Dependency_R) x Congruence_Factor`
- **Hypothesis lifecycle**: Tracks assumptions from L0 (abductive guess) through L1 (logically verified) to L2 (empirically validated)
- **Weakest link identification**: Every recommendation chain explicitly names its least reliable evidence
- **Audit trail**: State written to `.fpf/` directory for traceability
